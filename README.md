### Hello!
My name's Denneya (pronounced Den-knee-a) and I'm currently studying to be a Data Scientist at the University of Technology, Sydney.
I decided to explore the incredible world of data due to my curiosity of what's going on behind the scenes of how the world operates.
I want to be challenged each day and build the knowledge required to be the best I can be!
