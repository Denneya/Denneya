### Hello!
My name's Denneya (pronounced Den-knee-a) and I'm currently studying to be a Data Scientist at the University of Technology, Sydney.
I decided to explore the incredible world of data due to my curiosity of what's going on behind the scenes of how the world operates.
I want to be challenged each day and build the knowledge required to be the best I can be!

I began my career as a High School Music Teacher, which I then retrained to be a Mathematics Teacher and am now an aspiring Data Scientist. 

Considering I began this degree with no coding experience, here are the skills I have developed throughout 2022!

### What I'm Working On
* I recently began Danny Ma's **Serious SQL Challenge**. I'm looking forward to uploading the case studies once complete.
* Second year of uni is about to begin! This semester's subjects will be Natural Language Processing, UNIX Systems Programming and Data Visualisation and Narratives. I'll be uploaded some interesting content from those subjects, particularly DVN. 

### Facts About Me
üéπ I've played piano for 22 years; classically trained and hope to one day complete my AMUSA.

üêà‚Äç I have two beautiful cats. They bring so much joy to my life (and stress!).
