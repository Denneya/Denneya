### Hello!
My name's Denneya (pronounced Den-knee-a) and I'm currently studying to be a Data Scientist at the University of Technology, Sydney.
I decided to explore the incredible world of data due to my curiosity of what's going on behind the scenes of how the world operates.
I want to be challenged each day and build the knowledge required to be the best I can be!

I began my career as a High School Music Teacher, which I then retrained to be a Mathematics Teacher and am now an aspiring Data Scientist. 

Considering I began this degree with no coding experience, here are the skills I have developed throughout 2022!
